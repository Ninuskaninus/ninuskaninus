## Hello! :relaxed:
### My name is Nina Amdal, and I am a Frontend developer

## :sunglasses: About me 
At the moment, I am studying frontend development at Noroff full time, while also working as a frontend developer at LO-Media in Oslo. I really love the development-world, and I am so glad that I decided to jump into the digital designing world. Previously I have been working as a graphic designer and a media graphic designer. After taking a year with UI/UX-design at Noroff, I realized that just designing websites was not enough, I really wanted to be able to build them too. So I did! 

### :see_no_evil: Really about me 
I am a 28 year old woman, currently living in Oslo. I just moved here, and love the "big" city life. In my spare time, when I'm not studying or working, I really like to play games. My favorite of all time is Civilisation, and I can spend hours upon hours just conquring the world (or try to). Other than that, I would love to say that I love to exercise, but I dont... What I DO love tho, is spending time with my friends and family. And go for long walks, spend time outside in parks or just walking in the city. But the best place in the world is my gamingroom alongside with my boyfriend. (Who crushes me at CIV) 

### :computer: My work
Since may 2023, I have been so lucky to get a job as a frontend-developer at LO-media. This is despite of me not being done with the studies yet, and my learning curve is STEAP to say the least. I love my job, and I am really looking forward to become a good developer. 

## :heart: Developing things i love
- :computer: Prototyping is so much fun
- :art: Designing logos, always a bonus
- :crystal_ball: Somehow I always end up with dark-themed websites... I should try a brighter one next time
- :nail_care: That moment when you realize the , ; or whatever is messing up your code, and suddently it all works
- :alien: I am so glad I started developing at the same time AI exploded... (Must be honest)
